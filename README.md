## Functionality
The Visualization Extension ***sense-navigation*** for Qlik Sense allows you to add a button to a Qlik Sense sheet to navigate in your app:

* Go to first sheet
* Go to next sheet
* Go to previous sheet
* Go to last sheet
* Go to a sheet
* Go to a sheet (defined by sheet Id)
* Go to a story
* Open a website / eMail
* Switch to the Edit mode

The button can be easily styled nicely by selecting some of the predefined designs.

Furthermore ***sense-navigation*** offers the option to define **actions** which will be executed **before** the navigation happens.
This could for example be:

* Apply a bookmark
* Clear selections
* Lock selections
* Unlock selections
* Select value(s) in a field
* Select alternatives
* Select possible values in a field
* Set a variable value

See [here](./docs/actions.md) for a complete list of all available 20 actions.

Note: The main difference between version 0.x and 1.x of sense-navigation is that with v1.x you can define more than two actions.

## Layout
### Button Themes

There are several predefined styles available, you can choose from:

### Button icons

Every button can also include an icon:

***sense-navigation*** offers in total 851 icons to use:
 
- Icon library [Fontawesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/): 675 icons
- Icon library [Leonardo UI icons](https://qlik-oss.github.io/leonardo-ui/icons.html): 176 icons

<!-- Todo: Has to be removed, is a duplicate ... -->
<!-- See here: https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/blob/v1.0/docs/config-layout.md#predefined-styles-by-expression -->
### Button Style by Qlik Expression

Buttons can also be [styled based on a custom expression](docs/config-layout.md#advanced-styling):

> ![](docs/images/sense_navigation__style_by_expression.png)

The expression has to result into on of the following values:

- `bs3-
### Custom Styles (Custom CSS)

If you want to have full freedom over designing your button, just use CSS:

## Installation & Download
### Fresh Installation

0. ⚠️ **Do not download the entire Github repository, this will not work!**
1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/raw/master/build/sense-navigation_latest.zip) or [any other version](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/tree/master/build) you want to install.
2. Then install on either *Qlik Sense Desktop* or *Qlik Sense Server*:

* Qlik Sense Desktop
	* To install, unzip all files and copy the content to the folder folder `"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions\sense-navigation"`
* Qlik Sense Server
	* See instructions [how to import an extension on Qlik Sense Server](http://help.qlik.com/sense/2.0/en-US/online/#../Subsystems/ManagementConsole/Content/import-extensions.htm)

If you are running into any troubles, see [here for some FAQ](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-extension-install).

### You are already using an ***sense-navigation*** version < 1.x?

* I have unfortunately bad news: All versions < 1.x of ***sense-navigation*** do not seamlessly upgrade to version v1.x!
* If you upgrade to v1.x, you will have to
  * First install new new version of ***sense-navigation***.
  * Delete existing old instances of ***sense-navigation***.
  * Add it again to your sheets and apply the previous configurations.
  
### Should I upgrade?

See [here for more information](./docs/why-upgrade.md) what v1.x gives you and whether you should upgrade or not.

## Configuration
Drag & drop the object onto a sheet (as you would do it with any other native object or visualization extension).
Then define how the ***sense-navigation*** should behave:

- [Layout Options](./docs/config-layout.md)
- [Actions](./docs/config-actions.md)
- [Navigation Behavior](./docs/config-navigation-behavior.md)

## Compatibility
**sense-navigation** is designed to work with Qlik Sense *September 2017* or higher.
If you want to use _sense-navigation_ in older versions, install an older version than v1.0.

### ***sense-navigation*** & Mashups

***sense-navigation*** it built to be used within the Qlik Sense Client.
Any usage in a mashup-based solution might work, but there are many features in ***sense-navigation*** which can never work in a mashup-based solution (e.g. "Go to next sheet", "Go to edit mode", etc.).
So use ***sense-navigation*** in a mashup-based solution only at your own risk!

### ***sense-navigation*** & DevHub

If you want use & modify the extension in DevHub, then you have two options:

- Use the file `./build/*_dev.zip`, this always represents the latest development build (so no minimized/uglified files, etc.)
- Fork the entire repository and follow the [instructions how to build the extensions](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-extension-contrib)
