## Functionality
The Visualization Extension ***sense-navigation*** for Qlik Sense allows you to add a button to a Qlik Sense sheet to navigate in your app:

* Go to first sheet
* Go to next sheet
* Go to previous sheet
* Go to last sheet
* Go to a sheet
* Go to a sheet (defined by sheet Id)
* Go to a story
* Open a website / eMail
* Switch to the Edit mode

The button can be easily styled nicely by selecting some of the predefined designs ([Leonardo UI](https://qlik-oss.github.io/leonardo-ui/) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)) or modified with your custom CSS.

Furthermore ***sense-navigation*** offers the option to define a **chain of 1-n actions** which will be executed **before** the navigation happens.  

For example:

* Apply a bookmark
* Clear selections
* Lock selections
* Unlock selections
* Select value(s) in a field
* Select alternatives
* Select possible values in a field
* Set a variable value

See [here](./docs/actions.md) for a complete list of all available **20 actions**.

_Note: The main difference between version 0.x and 1.x of sense-navigation is that with v1.x you can define a chain of unlimited actions instead of just two._

## Installation & Download
### Fresh Installation

0. ⚠️ **Do not download the entire Github repository, this will not work!**
1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/raw/v1.0/build/sense-navigation_latest.zip) version (or [any other version](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/tree/master/build) you want to install).
2. Then install on either *Qlik Sense Desktop* or *Qlik Sense Server*:

* Qlik Sense Desktop
	* To install, unzip all files and copy the content to the folder folder `"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions\sense-navigation"`
* Qlik Sense Server
	* See instructions [how to import an extension on Qlik Sense Server](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/September2018/Subsystems/ManagementConsole/Content/Sense_QMC/import-extensions.htm)

If you are running into any troubles, see [here for some FAQs](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-extension-install).

### You are already using an ***sense-navigation*** version < 1.x?

* I have unfortunately bad news: All versions < 1.x of ***sense-navigation*** are completely incompatible with version v1.x!
* If you upgrade to v1.x, you will have to
  * First uninstall the old ***sense-navigation*** extension (delete the folder in Qlik Sense Desktop or use QMC in Qlik Sense Server to remove the extension)
  * First install the new version of ***sense-navigation***.
  * Delete existing old instances of ***sense-navigation*** object in your apps.
  * Add it again to your sheets and apply the previous configurations.
  
### Should I upgrade?

See [here for more information](./docs/why-upgrade.md) what v1.x gives you and whether you should upgrade or not.

### Where do I find the 0.8x version of sense-navigation

Please go [https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/tree/v0.8.x](here).

## Layout
***sense-navigation*** offers various options to define the layout of a button:

### Button Themes

There are several predefined styles available, you can choose from:

> ![](docs/images/sense_navigation__button_themes.png)

### Button icons

Every button can also include an icon. You can chose from a list of 851 available icons:
 
- Icon library [Fontawesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/): 675 icons
- Icon library [Leonardo UI icons](https://qlik-oss.github.io/leonardo-ui/icons.html): 176 icons

> ![](docs/images/sense_navigation__button_icons.png)

### Button Style by Qlik Expression

Buttons can also [chose a predefined style/theme based based on a custom expression](docs/config-layout.md#advanced-styling):

> ![](docs/images/sense_navigation__style_by_expression.png)

### Custom Styles (Custom CSS)

If you want to have full freedom over designing your button, just [use your custom CSS](docs/config-layout.md#custom-css):

> ![](docs/images/sense_navigation__style_by_css.png)

Result:

## Configuration
Drag & drop the object onto a sheet (as you would do it with any other native object or visualization extension).
Then define how the ***sense-navigation*** should behave:

- [Actions](./docs/config-actions.md)
- [Navigation Behavior](./docs/config-navigation-behavior.md)

### ***sense-navigation*** & Mashups

***sense-navigation*** it built to be used within the Qlik Sense Client.
Any usage in a mashup-based solution ***might work***, but there are many features in ***sense-navigation*** which can just never work in a mashup-based solution (e.g. "Go to next sheet", "Go to edit mode", etc.).
So use ***sense-navigation*** in a mashup-based solution only at your own risk!

### ***sense-navigation*** & DevHub

If you want use & modify the extension in DevHub, do the following:

- Use the file `./build/*_dev.zip`, this always represents the latest development build (so no minimized/uglified files, etc.)
