## Purpose and Description
The Visualization Extension ***sense-navigation*** for Qlik Sense allows you to add a button to a Qlik Sense sheet to navigate in your app:

* Go to the next sheet
* Go to the previous sheet
* Go to a specific sheet
* Go to a sheet (defined by the sheet Id)
* Go to a story
* Open a website
* Switch to the edit mode

The button can be easily styled nicely by selecting some of the predefined designs.

Furthermore ***sense-navigation*** offers the option to define **actions**~ which will be executed **before** the navigation happens.
This could for example be:

* Apply a bookmark
* Clear selections
* Lock selections
* Unlock selections
* Select value(s) in a field
* Select alternatives
* Select possible values in a field
* Set a variable value

See [here](./docs/actions.md) for a complete list of all available 20 actions.

Note: The main difference between version 0.x and 1.x of sense-navigation is that with v1.x you can define more than two actions.

## Screenshots
### Button styles

There are several predefined styles available, you can choose from:

### Button icons
Every button can also include an icon:

**sense-navigation** uses the [Fontawesome icons](http://fontawesome.io/), therefore you can select from a collection of 675 icons.

## Installation & Download
### Fresh Installation

0. **Do not download the entire Github repository, this will not work!**
1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/raw/master/build/sense-navigation_latest.zip) or [any other version](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/tree/master/build) you want to install.
2. Then install on either *Qlik Sense Desktop* or *Qlik Sense Server*:

* Qlik Sense Desktop
	* To install, unzip all files and copy the content to the folder folder `"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions\sense-navigation"`
* Qlik Sense Server
	* See instructions [how to import an extension on Qlik Sense Server](http://help.qlik.com/sense/2.0/en-US/online/#../Subsystems/ManagementConsole/Content/import-extensions.htm)

### You are already using an **sense-navigation** version 0.x?

* I have unfortunately bad news: Version 0.x of **sense-navigation** does not seamlessly upgrade to version v1.x of **sense-navigation**!
* If you upgrade to v1.x, you will have to
  * First install new new version of **sense-navigation**.
  * Delete existing old instances of **sense-navigation**.
  * Add it again to your sheets and apply the previous configurations.

## Configuration
Drag & drop the object onto a sheet (as you would do it with any other native object or visualization extension).
Then define how the **sense-navigation** should behave:

- [Layout Options](./docs/config-layout.md)
- [Navigation Behavior](./docs/config-navigation-behavior.md)
- [Actions](./docs/config-actions.md)

## Compatibility
**sense-navigation** is designed to work with Qlik Sense 2.1.1 or higher.
If you use the extension in an older version of Qlik Sense some functionality (like navigating to another sheet, etc.) will simply not work because the [Capability APIs](https://help.qlik.com/sense/2.1/en-US/developer/Subsystems/APIs/Content/mashup-api-reference.htm) used in this extension are not available in earlier versions.

### **sense-navigation** & Mashups

**sense-navigation** it built to be used within the Qlik Sense Client.
Any usage in a mashup-based solution might work, but there are many features in **sense-navigation** which can never work in a mashup-based solution (e.g. "Go to next sheet", "Go to edit mode", etc.).
So use **sense-navigation** in a mashup-based solution only at your own risk!

## Room for improvement / contribution
* Allow to add **additional styles for the button** (very similar to [sense-themable-kpi-tile](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-themable-kpi-tile))
* Allow templates for buttons ([see here](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/issues/14))
* **Additional actions**, e.g.
	* Reload the app
	* Opening another app and pass the current selections to the app (similar to "document chaining in QlikView")
* Allow icons instead of images ([see here](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/issues/37))
* Select fields instead of defining fields in the expression editor ([see here](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/issues/25))
	
Is there **anything else you'd like to see** in this visualization extension?

* Don't hesitate to add the feature and create a pull request!
* You don't have the time or skills to implement this specific feature? No problem, [drop a note here](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/issues).
