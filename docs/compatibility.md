**sense-navigation** is designed to work with Qlik Sense *September 2017* or higher.
If you want to use _sense-navigation_ in older versions, install an older version than v1.0.

### **sense-navigation** & Mashups

**sense-navigation** it built to be used within the Qlik Sense Client.
Any usage in a mashup-based solution might work, but there are many features in **sense-navigation** which can never work in a mashup-based solution (e.g. "Go to next sheet", "Go to edit mode", etc.).
So use **sense-navigation** in a mashup-based solution only at your own risk!
