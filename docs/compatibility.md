**sense-navigation** is designed to work with Qlik Sense *September 2017* or higher.
If you want to use _sense-navigation_ in older versions, install an older version than v1.0.

### ***sense-navigation*** & Mashups

***sense-navigation*** it built to be used within the Qlik Sense Client.
Any usage in a mashup-based solution might work, but there are many features in ***sense-navigation*** which can never work in a mashup-based solution (e.g. "Go to next sheet", "Go to edit mode", etc.).
So use ***sense-navigation*** in a mashup-based solution only at your own risk!
