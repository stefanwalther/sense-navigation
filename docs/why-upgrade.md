# sense-navigation 0.8.x vs 1.x

Version 1.x of ***sense-navigation*** is basically a re-write of the extension, based on the feedback I have received since first publishing the extension in 2015.  

I have actually tried to make v1.x backwards-compatible, but finally decided to go for a clean v1.x version instead of making the new v1.x version fully backwards-compatible with any version < v1.x.

## Why should you upgrade to v1.x

v1.x of ***sense-navigation*** offers significantly more functionality than any other version before:

- Unlimited actions, actions are truly chained.
- 8 new actions
  - Move forwards (in your selections) 
  - Move backwards (in your selections)
- New navigation actions such as
  - Go to first sheet
  - Go to last sheet
  - Switch to Edit mode
  - Lock all selections
  - Lock a specific field
  - Unlock a specific field
  - Unlock all and clear all
  - Select all values in a field
  - Select a value and lock field
  - Select possible values in a field
  - Toggle field selection
- More button themes and button layout options
- Custom CSS
- Conditional button layout
- Easier to configure (completely re-organized property panel)

For the full list of all changes introduced and fixes made in v1.x, [please look here](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/pull/58).

## When should you stick to v8.x

If you already have a lot of applications using ***sense-navigation*** in any of the versions < v1.x and you do not want to invest the effort to upgrade each of the objects, stick to v0.8.x.  
But please be aware that I am not planning to bring any of the v1.x features into the [v0.8.x branch](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/tree/v0.8.x).

## How long will v8.x maintained?

For the upcoming months and releases of Qlik Sense Desktop/Server I am still planning to support the [v0.8.x branch](https://github.com/stefanwalther/sense-navigation/tree/v0.8.x) of this extension.  
But support will definitely limited in time, so please try to upgrade to the v1.x track.
