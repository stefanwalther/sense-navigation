Drag & drop the object onto a sheet (as you would do it with any other native object or visualization extension).
Then define how the **sense-navigation** should behave:

### Layout

> ![]({%= verb.baseImgUrl %}docs/images/sense_navigation_props_layout.png)

* **Label** - The buttons label.
* **Style** - Select one of the predefined styles.
* **Button Width** - Whether the button should spread of the entire grid column or just be as wide as necessary.
* **Alignment** - Align the button to "Left", "Center" or right of the parent container.
* **Multiline** - Whether the button can take one than more line.
* **Icon** - Choose one of the provided icons (based on [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/))


### Navigation Behavior
Define the behavior of the button. The following options are available:

> ![]({%= verb.baseImgUrl %}docs/images/sense_navigation_behavior.png) 

* Go to the next sheet
* Go to the previous sheet
* Go to a specific sheet (if selected you'll see a list of sheets you can select from)
* Go to a story (if selected you'll see a list of stories you can select from)
* Open website (if selected, you'll have to enter the URL in the appearing text box)

### Actions
You can furthermore define up to two action which will be executed before the navigation behavior will be performed.

First enable this option:

> ![]({%= verb.baseImgUrl %}docs/images/sense_navigation_actions_enable.png)

Then select from the list of predefined actions:

> ![]({%= verb.baseImgUrl %}docs/images/sense_navigation_actions.png)

Depending on the selected action you'll see additional settings you can define, e.g. define the name of a variable and its value:

> ![]({%= verb.baseImgUrl %}docs/images/sense_navigation_actions_settings.png)

As soon as you have defined the first action, you will also be able to define a second action.
